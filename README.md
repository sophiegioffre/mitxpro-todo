# todo-list-react

## DESCRIPTION
A ToDo list app made with React following the CRUD model. This app allows you to create/add items to a ToDo list, read/view all items on that list, and delete/remove items from the list by clicking on it.

## HOW TO RUN
Clone all files in this repo to your local drive. Utilize a local host http server to view. Edit styles!

## ROAD MAP TO FUTURE IMRPOVEMENTS
I plan to improve this project in the following ways:
<br>
-create a button component
<br>
-create an edit button (to edit a to-do list item) and a specific delete button (to delete a to-do list item)
